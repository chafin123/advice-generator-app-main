## My process
I start with getting the compantent designed properly. Then hooking up the Advice Slip API and adding the onclick function to the relevant html to show the randomly generated quote and the advice id number. After that I want to add some thing extra to it so I added a typewriter effect to the compnent but I didn't want to just add a library, I wanted to figure out how to do it in JS. I tried several methods and follwed a few articles untill I found the current solution which works great and it works on advice generation. One of the problems I had was that if you pressed the button before the advice was fully typed it would spit out gibberish, in order to fix this I disabled the button upon function start and therenabled the button once it was finished. I then made the dice button spin to help indicate it was an interactive button and it makes it look like rolling dice!
